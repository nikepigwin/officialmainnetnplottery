# 🔧 Private Key Format Diagnosis

## 🎯 Problem Identified:
**Lucid rejects the private key with "Invalid secret key" error**

Your logs showed:
```
🔗 Lucid initialized successfully with Preview network
🔐 Attempting to select wallet with private key...
❌ Lucid error details: Invalid secret key
```

## 🧪 Multi-Format Testing Deployed:

The backend now tries **4 different private key formats** that Lucid might accept:

### **Method 1: Raw Hex (Current)**
- Format: `e93cdb3805a07601b7f3b270e361b51d3823f6839d17393c634d4a78732ce809`
- Status: ❌ Failed (confirmed)

### **Method 2: Bech32 Format**
- Format: `ed25519_sk1e93cdb3805a07601b7f3b270e361b51d3823f6839d17393c634d4a78732ce809`
- Expected: ✅ Most likely to work

### **Method 3: Hex with 0x Prefix**
- Format: `0xe93cdb3805a07601b7f3b270e361b51d3823f6839d17393c634d4a78732ce809`
- Expected: 🤔 Possible alternative

### **Method 4: Original CBOR Format**
- Format: `5820e93cdb3805a07601b7f3b270e361b51d3823f6839d17393c634d4a78732ce809`
- Expected: 🤔 Last resort

## 📊 What to Watch For:

**In 2-3 minutes**, watch your Render logs for:

```
🔐 Attempting to select wallet with private key...
❌ Method 1 (hex) failed: Invalid secret key
❌ Method 2 (ed25519_sk1) failed: [error] OR ✅ Method 2 (ed25519_sk1): Successfully loaded wallet
```

## 🎯 Expected Outcome:

**Most likely:** Method 2 (ed25519_sk1) will succeed, and you'll see:
```
✅ Method 2 (ed25519_sk1): Successfully loaded wallet
🏦 Using pool wallet: addr_test1vp6jucpj0sdclz4trdnzvtqs6x3e7vaq8psauzhcl0jd0vc3qnet5
✅ Pool wallet address matches expected address
💰 Pool wallet balance: 1796.81 ADA
🏗️ Building transaction for 3 winners...
✅ Transaction built successfully
✅ Transaction signed successfully
🚀 Transaction submitted: [hash]
```

## 🔧 Next Steps Based on Results:

### **If Method 2 Works:**
- ✅ **Problem solved!** Update Render env var to `ed25519_sk1...` format
- 🎉 Automated distribution will work

### **If All Methods Fail:**
- 🔄 Generate new extended private key with `cardano-cli`
- 🔐 Use different key generation method
