# 🏆 Render Winners Persistence - COMPREHENSIVE FIX

## 🚨 Problem Analysis

**Issue**: Winners data disappears on Render deployment after a few hours.

**Root Causes**:
1. **Render file system is ephemeral** - `/tmp` directory gets cleared on restarts
2. **Environment variables are read-only** - `Deno.env.set()` doesn't work on Render
3. **Backend might be restarting** - causing data loss
4. **No persistent storage mechanism** - data is lost between deployments

## 🔧 Solution Strategy

### **Primary Storage**: Environment Variables (Render-Compatible)
- ✅ **Persistent**: Survives server restarts
- ✅ **Manual Updates**: Can be updated via Render dashboard
- ✅ **Reliable**: Always available on Render

### **Backup Storage**: File System (Local Development)
- ✅ **Local Testing**: Works for development
- ✅ **Automatic**: No manual intervention needed
- ✅ **Fallback**: Secondary storage method

## 📋 Implementation Steps

### **Step 1: Update Render Environment Variables**

1. **Go to Render Dashboard**
   - Navigate to your Render service
   - Click on "Environment" tab

2. **Add/Update Environment Variable**
   ```
   Key: NIKEPIG_HISTORICAL_WINNERS
   Value: []
   ```

3. **Deploy the Updated Backend**
   - The new code prioritizes environment variables
   - Will automatically load from environment on startup

### **Step 2: Manual Data Recovery (If Needed)**

If you have previous winners data, you can manually add it to the environment variable:

1. **Format the data as JSON array**:
   ```json
   [
     {
       "roundNumber": 1,
       "winners": [
         {
           "position": 1,
           "address": "addr_test1...",
           "amount": 100,
           "percentage": 50,
           "transactionId": "tx_hash_here",
           "claimedAt": "2025-08-06T10:00:00.000Z"
         }
       ],
       "totalPool": 200,
       "drawDate": "2025-08-06T10:00:00.000Z",
       "totalParticipants": 5,
       "totalTickets": 10
     }
   ]
   ```

2. **Update Render Environment Variable**:
   - Copy the JSON array
   - Paste it as the value for `NIKEPIG_HISTORICAL_WINNERS`

### **Step 3: Verify the Fix**

1. **Check Backend Logs**:
   Look for these messages:
   ```
   📊 Loaded X rounds from environment (Render primary storage)
   💾 Saved X rounds to environment (Render primary storage)
   ```

2. **Test API Endpoint**:
   ```bash
   curl https://your-render-url/api/lottery/winners
   ```

3. **Check Frontend**:
   - Weekly/Monthly tabs should show winners
   - No more "No historical winners yet" message

## 🔄 Data Flow (Updated)

### **On Startup**:
1. **Check environment variable** (primary for Render)
2. **If environment has data**: Load and use ✅
3. **If environment empty**: Check file storage (local backup)
4. **If both empty**: Start fresh ✅

### **When Winners Are Selected**:
1. **Save to environment** (primary for Render)
2. **Save to file** (backup for local development)
3. **Log instructions** for manual environment updates

### **API Response**:
1. **Load from memory** (loaded from environment)
2. **Validate data structure** ✅
3. **Return to frontend** ✅

## 🎯 Render-Specific Considerations

### **Environment Variable Limitations**:
- **Read-only**: Can't be written by code
- **Manual updates**: Must be updated via dashboard
- **Size limits**: Large data might hit limits

### **File System Limitations**:
- **Ephemeral**: Cleared on restarts
- **Not persistent**: Not suitable for Render
- **Local only**: Works for development

### **Recommended Approach**:
1. **Use environment variables** as primary storage
2. **Manual updates** when new winners are selected
3. **Regular backups** of winners data
4. **Monitor logs** for data persistence

## 📊 Monitoring and Maintenance

### **Daily Checks**:
1. **Backend logs**: Look for storage messages
2. **API endpoint**: Verify winners are returned
3. **Frontend display**: Check Weekly/Monthly tabs

### **Weekly Maintenance**:
1. **Backup winners data**: Export from environment
2. **Update environment**: If new winners added
3. **Verify persistence**: Test after restarts

### **Monthly Tasks**:
1. **Archive old data**: Move to separate storage
2. **Clean environment**: Remove old entries
3. **Update documentation**: Keep records current

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

### **Before Deployment**:
- [ ] Update environment variable with current winners
- [ ] Verify backend code changes are deployed
- [ ] Test local environment first

### **After Deployment**:
- [ ] Check backend logs for storage messages
- [ ] Test API endpoint returns winners
- [ ] Verify frontend displays winners correctly
- [ ] Monitor for 24 hours to ensure persistence

### **Ongoing Maintenance**:
- [ ] Update environment variable when new winners selected
- [ ] Monitor backend logs for errors
- [ ] Backup winners data regularly
- [ ] Test after any Render restarts

## 🎯 Success Criteria

- [ ] Winners data persists after Render restarts
- [ ] Weekly/Monthly tabs show historical winners
- [ ] API endpoint returns correct winner count
- [ ] No more "No historical winners yet" messages
- [ ] Backend logs show proper storage operations

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **If Winners Still Disappear**:
1. **Check Render logs** for storage errors
2. **Verify environment variable** is set correctly
3. **Test API endpoint** directly
4. **Check backend deployment** is running

### **If API Returns 404**:
1. **Check Render service** is running
2. **Verify deployment** completed successfully
3. **Check environment variables** are configured
4. **Restart Render service** if needed
